## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Export environment variables

You need to set the following environment variables:

- `SANIC_ESA_TOKEN`: Esa API token. To generate, go "Settings > User Settings >
  Applications > Generate new token". Because this token is tied to a user, it
  is recommended to use the token generated by the user who is expected to
  access the Esa team for a long period of time.
- `SANIC_SLACK_TOKEN`: User OAuth Token beginning with `xoxp-`. You can obtain
  it from the "OAuth & Permissions" section of the app's administration page.

Export these variables:

```bash
$ export SANIC_ESA_TOKEN=<esa-token>
$ export SANIC_SLACK_TOKEN=<slack-token>
```

## Start the server

```bash
$ sanic main.app
```
