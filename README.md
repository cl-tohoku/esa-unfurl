## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Acquire environment variables

You need to set the following environment variables:

- `ESA_TOKEN`: Esa API token. To generate, go "Settings > User Settings >
  Applications > Generate new token". Because this token is tied to a user, it
  is recommended to use the token generated by the user who is expected to
  access the Esa team for a long period of time.
- `SLACK_TOKEN`: User OAuth Token beginning with `xoxp-`. You can obtain
  it from the "OAuth & Permissions" section of the app's administration page.

### Setting of AWS

- Create a zip file for the python environment in AWS
```bash
pip install . -t layer/python
cd layer
zip -r mypackage.zip *
```
- Upload the zip file to create a layer of aws
- Activate the layer in the lambda function
- Set environment variables for lambda functions
